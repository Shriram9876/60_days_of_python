# 60_days_of_python
i am a complete novice when it comes to coding but i love about the things that can be done through coding so i want to start my coding journey and "you are free to leave advise or some exercise" i can do to learn more about coding. i am starting with python as it is readable in human language. (i will at least try to finish 60 days)
